# roop for StableDiffusion

This is an extension for StableDiffusion's [AUTOMATIC1111 web-ui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/) that allows face-replacement in images. It is based on [roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop) but will be developed seperately.

+ Download the "inswapper_128.onnx" model from [here](https://huggingface.co/henryruhs/roop/resolve/main/inswapper_128.onnx) and put it inside `<web-ui-dir>/extensions/roop/models` directory.

On Windows, Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater must be installed before installing the extension. [During the install, make sure to include the Python and C++ packages.](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/issues/153)

## Usage

1. Under "roop" drop-down menu, import an image containing a face.
2. Turn on the "Enable" checkbox
3. That's it, now the generated result will have the face you selected

### The result face is blurry
Use the "Restore Face" option. You can also try the "Upscaler" option or for more finer control, use an upscaler from the "Extras" tab.

### There are multiple faces in result
Select the face numbers you wish to swap using the "Comma separated face number(s)" option.

### The result is totally black
This means roop detected that your image is NSFW.

### Img2Img

You can choose to activate the swap on the source image or on the generated image, or on both using the checkboxes. Activating on source image allows you to start from a given base and apply the diffusion process to it.

Inpainting should work but only the masked part will be swapped.
